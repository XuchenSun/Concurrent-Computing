# Concurrent-Computing
Hello Everyone!

My name is Xuchen and these are my some programs about concurrent computing.
    
Some descriptions about the programs are given in followed.
    
I hope these programs will help you.
    
Best wishes!

Descriptions about Jacobi Parallel Method.cpp

Jacobi_Method_Parallel is a funtion to get the valuse of X
Jacobi method is a square system of n linear equations, where Ax=b
    Input:the matrxX size, the valude of  matrix X and b
    Output : The convergence value of X 

Matrix A
*   matrixA=[a11,a12,a13,a14....a1n
*            a21,a22,a23,a24....a2n
*                               a3n
*             an1,an2,an3........ann]
Matrix B:b is a vertical column
*    b=[b1,
*	    b2,
*		b3,
*		b4,
*		...
*		bn]
The output is the x
*    x =[x1,
*	     x2,
*		 x3,
*		 x4,
*		 ...
*		 xn
